### Hexchat-plugins

these are hexchat plugins I made for personal use - they may not have the best code standards, best practices, best features, or anything, they may possibly be a little buggy - but they may also be of use to some people.

they were created for my use and you're welcome to grab them and build off of them or use them, but just be careful - not everything may be airtight and there may be some bugs, so be weary.

thanks for checking them out!
